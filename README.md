# Spotify API Project

This project uses the Spotify API to get the name and artists of the current track and display it on a website. The project is split into two parts: the frontend and the backend.

## Installation

Both the backend and frontend have an `.env.example` file that needs to be renamed to `.env`. For the backend, you also need to replace `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` with your own ID and secret from the Spotify dashboard.

### Backend

To install the backend

rename `.env.example` to `.env`

Then open the `.env` file and replace the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` values with your own.

### Frontend

To install the frontend

rename `.env.example` to `.env`

## Usage

To start the backend

```bash
npm install
npm dev
```

This will start the backend on `http://localhost:8888`.

To start the frontend

```bash
npm install
npm dev
```

This will start the frontend on `http://localhost:3000`.

In the frontend code, the backend endpoint is set to `http://localhost:8888` and the backend WebSocket is set to `ws://localhost:8888`.
